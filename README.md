# COMP1005 TA Portal

(help wanted!)

## Description

A small marking portal for TAs. Upload a zipped file with the student's name and number, containing the student's `.py` files.
The files will be run with pre-defined test-cases, and you can enter your marks to produce an HTML table that can be pasted directly into CULearn.

## Setup

To build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobdanovitch/COMP1005_TA_Portal.git
cd COMP1005_TA_Portal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

The files may be double-clicked or run through the terminal.

To run on Windows:
```cmd
run.bat
```

To run on Linux:
```bash
./run.sh
```

Note: This will launch into a standalone Chrome window. If you don't have Chrome installed, get rid of the final line of the run script.
